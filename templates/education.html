    <h1>Nice — you reached the training page</h1>

    <h3>Red flags you just saw</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Unexpected sense of urgency (“verify now” / “avoid suspension”)</li>
      <li>Generic greeting instead of your name</li>
      <li>Link points to a non-official domain (in real phishing)</li>
      <li>Requests for credentials or IDs via email link</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How to handle real suspicious messages</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Do not click links. Hover to inspect link targets if possible.</li>
      <li>Verify by contacting the sender through a known, separate channel.</li>
      <li>Report to security team using the approved process.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Thanks for participating — this was a training simulation. If this was unexpected, reach out to security@yourorg.example</p>
